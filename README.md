🚀 Fluxen
=========

**AI Traffic, Optimized.**

Fluxen is a modern, self-hosted AI gateway that sits between your applications and LLM providers to analyze, optimize, and control AI traffic.

Instead of sending requests directly to OpenAI, Anthropic, or other providers, route them through Fluxen to gain visibility, cost intelligence, policy enforcement, and intelligent traffic management.

🧠 Why Fluxen?
--------------

As organizations scale AI usage, common problems emerge:

*   Rising and unpredictable LLM costs
    
*   Lack of visibility into token usage
    
*   Repeated prompts wasting budget
    
*   No governance or policy enforcement
    
*   No centralized AI control layer
    

Fluxen acts as a smart control plane for enterprise AI traffic.

🔄 How It Works
---------------

```
Application → Fluxen → LLM Provider  
```

Fluxen intercepts each request and can:

*   Analyze token usage
    
*   Estimate cost
    
*   Apply routing policies
    
*   Enforce limits
    
*   Perform context-aware caching
    
*   Log usage metrics
    
*   Forward optimized requests to providers
    

Applications only change the base URL — no major code changes required.

✨ Core Features (v0.1 Roadmap)
------------------------------

🎯 Vision
---------

Fluxen aims to become the optimization and intelligence layer for enterprise AI infrastructure.

It is not just a proxy.It is a control and optimization engine for large-scale AI usage.

🏗 Architecture Overview
------------------------

Core modules:

*   Gateway (HTTP proxy layer)
    
*   Analyzer (token & cost engine)
    
*   Cache (semantic request reuse)
    
*   Policy engine (routing & enforcement)
    
*   Provider adapters (OpenAI, others)
    
*   Metrics store (PostgreSQL)
    

Designed to be modular and extensible.
