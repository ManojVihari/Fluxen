🚀 Fluxen

AI Traffic, Optimized.

Fluxen is a modern, self-hosted AI gateway that sits between your applications and LLM providers to analyze, optimize, and control AI traffic.

Instead of sending requests directly to OpenAI, Anthropic, or other providers, route them through Fluxen to gain visibility, cost intelligence, policy enforcement, and intelligent traffic management.

🧠 Why Fluxen?

As organizations scale AI usage, common problems emerge:

Rising and unpredictable LLM costs

Lack of visibility into token usage

Repeated prompts wasting budget

No governance or policy enforcement

No centralized AI control layer

Fluxen acts as a smart control plane for enterprise AI traffic.

🔄 How It Works
Application → Fluxen → LLM Provider


Fluxen intercepts each request and can:

Analyze token usage

Estimate cost

Apply routing policies

Enforce limits

Perform context-aware caching

Log usage metrics

Forward optimized requests to providers

Applications only change the base URL — no major code changes required.

⚡ Quick Start (Coming Soon)

Clone the repository:

Navigate into the directory:

cd fluxen


Start with Docker:

docker-compose up


Then point your application to:

http://localhost:8080

🎯 Vision

Fluxen aims to become the optimization and intelligence layer for enterprise AI infrastructure.

It is not just a proxy.
It is a control and optimization engine for large-scale AI usage.

🏗 Architecture Overview

Core modules:

Gateway (HTTP proxy layer)

Analyzer (token & cost engine)

Cache (semantic request reuse)

Policy engine (routing & enforcement)

Provider adapters (OpenAI, others)

Metrics store (PostgreSQL)

Designed to be modular and extensible.
